# Machine_Learning_Project

The project is made for ISE in RIT Final Year CSE Department

The name of project is Sales Prediction from Social Network Ads.
For this project we use Social Network Ads dataset from Kaggle website : https://www.kaggle.com/rakeshrau/social-network-ads

The dataset provides a categorical dataset to determine whether a user purchased a particular product.

Problem Statement :
The objective of this analysis is to predict whether a person will buy a product displayed on a social network ad or not, given their age, gender and salary and to compare the accuracy of different classification algorithms.

Methodology:
We have create an Exploratory Data Analysis and split it into three parts and also create a Model.ipynb file in which we did training on dataset and check which classifier among Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier and Gaussian Navive Bayes Classifier can give better results.

Conclusion :
The product seem to be intended for people within the range of 50 - 60 years, and it also seems to be intended both for male and Female gender.
As we saw on the Age vs Salary plots, it seems that the women analyzed have higher income than men, so this might be a reason for the slight difference between gender in purchased or not terms.
